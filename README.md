# Zomato Clone â€“ MERN Stack Project

This is a full-stack project inspired by Zomato, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Itâ€™s currently in progress, with the frontend layout completed using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal is to replicate core features of Zomato, like restaurant listings, search functionality, and user interactions such as reviews and order tracking.


# Features (Planned & Implemented):
- Responsive UI layout (Homepage clone)
- Restaurant listing sections
- Search bar (planned)
- User login and review system (to be added)

# Technologies:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React to be integrated)
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB



# Current Progress:
The frontend layout is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Next steps include converting it into a React-based SPA and connecting it to a backend server.
